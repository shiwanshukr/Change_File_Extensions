# Change_File_Extensions

## This program aims to rewrite/change your original extension to your desired extension.

The good thing about this prgram is you can change any number of different extensions.
Lets say, I have to change my ".HEIC", ".heic", ".png" ----> to "jpg"

You can put all your extensions that you want to change in original varibale in the program.
original          = [".HEIC",".heic","png"]

This extension ".jpg" is the desired extension that you want for example, so you can put this in the variable desired_extension.
desired_extension = ".jpg"

There is a variable named "folder" in the program. 
For me, all my pics were in this variable folder which I wanted to change.

folder = "/Users/shiwanshu/Pictures/Diwali/"

Finally, you can run your program.

Huraaay!
